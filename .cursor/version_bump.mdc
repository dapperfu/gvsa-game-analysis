# Version Bumping Rules

## Automatic Version Bumping

After every 10 commits, you MUST bump the version number by 0.0.1 (patch version increment) immediately prior to the last commit.

### Version Bump Logic:
- **Patch increment (0.0.1)**: After every 10 commits, increment the patch version (x.y.z -> x.y.z+1)
- **Minor increment (0.x.0)**: Every 1000 commits (100 version bumps of 0.0.1), roll over to the next minor version (x.y.z -> x.y+1.0)

### Implementation Steps:
1. Count commits since last version bump
2. When commit count reaches a multiple of 10:
   - Calculate new version based on current version and commit count
   - Update version in ALL locations:
     - `pyproject.toml` (version field)
     - `gvsa/__init__.py` (__version__ variable)
     - `gvsa/cli.py` (version parameter in @click.version_option)
   - Create a version bump commit with message: "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
   - This version bump commit should be made immediately prior to the 10th commit

### Version Calculation:
- For patch increments: If current version is X.Y.Z, new version is X.Y.(Z+1)
- For minor increments: If current version is X.Y.Z and we've reached 1000 commits total, new version is X.(Y+1).0

### Example Flow:
- Commits 1-9: No version bump
- Commit 10: Bump version (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1) BEFORE making commit 10
- Commits 11-19: No version bump
- Commit 20: Bump version (e.g., 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2) BEFORE making commit 20
- ...continues until 1000 commits...
- At commit 1000: Bump version (e.g., 1.9.9 -> 1.10.0) BEFORE making commit 1000

### Important Notes:
- Version bump must happen BEFORE the commit that triggers it (not after)
- All version strings must be kept in sync across all files
- Version bump commits should follow the standard commit message format specified in user rules
